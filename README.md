SQL 101 is a repository for learning SQL.
SQL, or structured query language, is an important tool for data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists. It's the language used to create, read, update, and delete information from relational databases. SQL lets you search, sort, aggregate, and analyze data to create complex reports to help make important business decisions. It's also used by application designers and programmers to modify, add, and delete data from databases.  This course will give you a basic understanding on how to use SQL in the Snowflake environment.
